## Programming Languages
These are the projects I did with each of the programming languages

### 🚀 JavaScript/TypeScript
#### Frontend:
- [tictactoe-react-eth](https://github.com/flametuner/eth-tictactoe-react): A react implementation of TicTacToe above blockchain.
- [pools-party](https://github.com/flametuner/pools-party): NextJS frontend with Bootstrap where the user can register and login for creating questions and answering them with GraphQL client.

#### Backend:
- [pools-party](https://github.com/flametuner/pools-party): GraphQL API for a gamified Pools app where users receive points for answering pools. I used Apollo with Express and Prisma (SQL). I also did a NestJS version of it. 

### 📄 Solidity
- [hrm-contracts](https://github.com/flametuner/hrm-contracts): My first ever blockchain project where we published a paper about hrm process in public institutions using blockchain
- [dagora-market](https://github.com/dagoramarket): My Graduation Thesis about a decentralized marketplace using Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat and The Graph.
- [blockchain-matchmaking](https://github.com/flametuner/blockchain-matchmaking): We used a TicTacToe for creating a ranking system using Elo Rating, and creating matchmaking inside blockchain.

### ☕ Java
I've been learning and working with programming for 10 years, you can find my very first projects in the [battlebits organization](https://github.com/battlebits) where I used Java to create plugins for a Mincraft server.

- [prime-number-generator](https://github.com/flametuner/prime-bignumber-generator): Generates random numbers of N bits and check for primality
- [scanner](https://github.com/flametuner/scanner): Lexical and syntactical analysis using ANTLR

### 🐍 Python

- [regular-language-automata](https://github.com/flametuner/regular-language-automata): Complete program that creates Deterministic Finite Automatons and test them.
- [computational-graphics](https://github.com/flametuner/computational-graphics): Learning process of Computational Graphics, drawing modes, calculations, using Qt and Python.

### 🔧 C and C++

- [epos](https://github.com/flametuner/epos-riscv): Implementation of SO structures for RiscV
- [data-structures](https://github.com/flametuner/data-structures): Implementation of various Data Structures using C++
